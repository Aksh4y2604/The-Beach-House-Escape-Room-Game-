The ece198.h file should be included at the start of your code, like this:

#include "ece198.h"

In the main.c file, you'll find a lot of sample code. We use conditional compilation
to select which sample is being used. Simply uncomment one (and only one) of the #define
statements at the top to compile the corresponding demo.

Feel free to use and modify any of the code you find here.
